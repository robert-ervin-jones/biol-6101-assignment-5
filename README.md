# Assignment 5: Phylogenetic Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
In this assignment, you will build a **Snakemake workflow** for phylogenetic analysis. You will start with a set of homologous gene sequences, perform multiple sequence alignment, trim and filter the alignments, and construct phylogenetic trees using two different approaches: the **species coalescent method** and the **supermatrix (concatenation) method**. You will assess tree support through bootstrap analysis, compare the results from both approaches, and visualize your findings. This assignment combines computational phylogenetics with reproducible workflow development and critical evaluation of phylogenetic methods.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:
- Perform multiple sequence alignment on homologous sequences
- Construct phylogenetic trees using maximum likelihood methods
- Compare species coalescent vs. supermatrix approaches to phylogeny
- Understand the assumptions and limitations of each phylogenetic method
- Evaluate tree reliability through bootstrap and coalescent support values
- Select appropriate evolutionary models for phylogenetic inference
- Assess concordance and discordance among gene trees
- Visualize and annotate phylogenetic trees
- Build reproducible phylogenetic workflows with Snakemake

### Sequence alignment tools:
- [MAFFT](https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/) (multiple alignment)
- [trimAl](http://trimal.cgenomics.org/) (alignment trimming)
- [BMGE](https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2148-10-210) (alignment filtering)

### Phylogenetic inference tools:
- [IQ-TREE](http://www.iqtree.org/) (maximum likelihood + model selection)
- [RAxML-NG](https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng) (maximum likelihood)
- [ASTRAL](https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL) (coalescent-based species tree estimation)

### Concatenation tools:
- [AMAS](https://github.com/marekborowiec/AMAS) (alignment manipulation and statistics)
- [catfasta2phyml](https://github.com/nylander/catfasta2phyml) (concatenate FASTA alignments)

### Tree analysis and visualization:
- [ETE3](http://etetoolkit.org/) (Python tree manipulation)
- R with packages: ape, phytools, ggtree, treeio, phangorn
- [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) (optional, for manual viewing)

**Important:** Use **per-rule conda environments** or **Apptainer containers** (stored in `workflow/envs/`) to ensure reproducibility and proper dependency management. You must create separate environment YAML files for each tool/rule.

Example base installation:
```bash
# Create a base environment with Snakemake if you don't have it already
mamba create -n snakemake -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakemake

# Create individual tool environment files in workflow/envs/
# Example: workflow/envs/mafft.yaml, workflow/envs/iqtree.yaml, etc.

# Alternatively, use Apptainer/Singularity containers
# Snakemake can automatically pull containers from conda packages
# Run with: snakemake --use-conda --use-apptainer
```

## Data
For this assignment, you need to provide your own homologous gene sequences for phylogenetic analysis. Download or prepare sequences from public databases or your own research.

**Data sources:**
- **NCBI**: Download gene sequences using Entrez Direct or the web interface
- **Ensembl**: Obtain gene sequences from model organisms
- **OrthoDB**: Download orthologous gene sets
- **OrthoFinder output**: Single-copy orthologous genes from genome comparisons

**Requirements:**
- Each FASTA file should contain sequences from the same gene/locus across different taxa
- Use 3-5 genes for a multi-locus analysis
- Start with 10-20 taxa (species/strains)
- Each gene alignment should be 500-2000 bp

**FASTA format example:**
```
>Species_A
ATCGATCG...
>Species_B
ATCGATGG...
```

## Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Multiple Sequence Alignment
Implement Snakemake rules to:
1. Align each gene/locus independently using **MAFFT**
2. Compute alignment statistics using **AMAS**
3. Trim/filter poorly aligned regions using **trimAl**
4. Generate a report on alignment quality for each gene

#### Expected outputs:

### Task 3b: Maximum Likelihood Phylogeny - Supermatrix Approach
Implement Snakemake rules to:
1. Concatenate alignments from multiple genes into a supermatrix
2. Create a partition file defining gene boundaries

2. Compare individual gene trees with both species trees
3. Calculate Robinson-Foulds distances between all tree pairs
4. Assess topological concordance across genes and methods
5. Visualize trees with support values using **R (ggtree)** or **Python (ETE3)**
6. Create comparison plots showing both approaches side-by-side

## Workflow Structure
Your final directory structure should look like:

```

**Note:** 
- Place your input sequence FASTA files in the `data/` directory and specify their location in `config/config.yaml`
- You must create all environment YAML files and analysis scripts yourself
- **AI Usage**: You may use AI assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) to help write analysis scripts (in `workflow/scripts/`), but the Snakemake workflow itself (`Snakefile`) must be your own work

## Running Your Workflow
Once your workflow is complete, run it with:
```bash
# Dry run to check workflow
snakemake -n

# Run workflow with 4 cores using conda
snakemake --cores 4 --use-conda

# Run workflow with Apptainer containers (alternative to conda)
snakemake --cores 4 --use-conda --use-apptainer

# Generate workflow diagram
snakemake --dag | dot -Tpng > workflow_dag.png
```

## Tips for Success
- **Start small**: Test your workflow on a subset of genes before running all
- **Validate alignments**: Visually inspect a few alignments to ensure quality
- **Monitor resources**: Bootstrap analyses can be computationally intensive
- **Understand the methods**: Read about the assumptions of coalescent vs. concatenation approaches
- **Check for discordance**: Examine individual gene trees for signals of incomplete lineage sorting
- **Create conda environments**: Write YAML files for each tool specifying channels and dependencies (or use Apptainer)
- **Write helper scripts**: Create scripts for tree comparison, visualization, and statistics
- **Document decisions**: Note why you chose specific parameters or models
- **Version control**: Use Git to track changes to your workflow
- **Read documentation**: Consult tool manuals and Snakemake docs for proper syntax
